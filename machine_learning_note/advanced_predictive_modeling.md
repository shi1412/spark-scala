# Introduction
  - When building predictive models, model accuracy is crucial. 
  - Random Forest -> XGBoost -> Depp Stacking
  - Trained test partitioning
  - Linear regression for value estimation for creating ensembles
# Key Modeling Concepts
  ### What is ensemble
  - blending the results from different models
  - issue:
    If the models making the same errors:

  It's better to have different errors for each models:

  ### Types of ensembles
  - Heterogeneous Ensembles: component models are completely different
  - Homogeneous Ensembles: Random Forests, AdaBoost, XGBoost
  - Metamodeling: multiple models working together to solve a problem; could be models sending information to other models; Could be different models for different cases
